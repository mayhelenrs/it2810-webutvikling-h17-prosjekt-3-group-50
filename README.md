### General file structure of the project <a name="FileStruct"></a>
We have split our project into two main folders: `app` and `website`.

The code is very similar in both parts,
but some changes has been made
to accommodate for the differences between React and React Native.

#### Website
* `website/public` contains the html file in which we put all our javascript into,
 to make it render. Also the favicon is placed in this folder.

* `website/src` contains, basically, our whole website. Everything is build up using react and javascript.
    * `website/src/assets` contains fonts, images and our css.
    * `website/src/components` contains all our components, which are used to construct our views.
        * `website/src/components/appointments` contains components related to our appointment-view.
        * `website/src/components/categories` contains components for categories.
        Categories are used to filter between different types of notes and todos.
        * `website/src/components/common` contains the components that are common for all the views.
        * `website/src/components/frontpage` contains components related to our front page.
        * `website/src/components/notes` contains  components related to our notes-view.
        * `website/src/components/schedule` contains components related to our schedule-view.
        * `website/src/components/todo` contains components related to our todo-view.
        * `website/src/components/index.jsx` exports all our components to make importing easier
    * `website/src/service` contains our service worker which allows for offline capabilities etc.
    * `website/src/views` contains all our views, these are all the different pages the website consists of.
    * `website/src/index.jsx` used to route between different views.


### App
The file structure for the app is basically the same as for the website.


### Setup <a name="Setup"></a>
To run the application you need:
* A web server to host the website
* A web browser to access the website
